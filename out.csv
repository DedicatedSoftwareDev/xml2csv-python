High Performance Computing (HPC) is an important element, however RCD has expanded well beyond HPC into secure enclaves for data compliance; big data management, analytics, and movement; AI/machine learning; and more recently into heterogeneous compute models, edge computing, and cloud-based computing. Researchers are struggling to keep pace with the explosion of data and the rapid evolution of computing resources, and often lack the skills to make full use of emerging tools and techniques. Developing and maintaining the needed expertise takes valuable time from research and is often beyond the capacity of researchers; they must depend upon partners (RCD professionals) who combine technology expertise and an understanding of research workflows and researcher needs. Institutions face challenges recruiting and retaining RCD professional staff, and building effective RCD support services. This CI CoE Demonstration Pilot (RCD CoE) will develop an RCD Resource and Career Center to advance and enable the nation's capacity for computational and data-intensive research by providing institutions and individuals the products, tools, services, and community to build and sustain successful RCD operations.  The project will also provide expertise in the development of new RCD professionals, and provide a voice and a connector for the broad community and the profession at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCD Resource and Career Center will build upon work that the NSF-supported Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) has done and continues to do to develop products and tools for effective RCD support. The Center will develop a robust and sustainable implementation of the RCD Capabilities Model that provides an assessment framework, support for benchmarking and strategic planning, and a community data set to understand the landscape of RCD support. The Center will expand and disseminate resources for RCD Professionalization, including support for adoption of an RCD Job Family Matrix to properly classify RCD professional roles and conducting a national census of RCD Professionals to characterize the current state of RCD staff and programs. The Center will create and disseminate a model of Career Arcs for RCD Professionals to explain career options and help existing RCD professionals explore professional development and advancement. Work in the project will aggregate resources for staff training and workforce development, including leading practices for recruitment, onboarding, advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and professional development, as well as proven models for student internship and training programs. The pilot period and the community of communities will be used to facilitate the creation of a coordinating organization to connect all the relevant communities and to develop a shared voice for RCD professionals as the project plans for a full Center of Excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",05/19/2021,05/19/2021,,Grant,47.070,1,4900,4900,2100003,Thomas,Cheatham,E,III,Thomas E Cheatham,tec3@utah.edu,000095070,05/19/2021,,Co-Principal Investigator,Dana,Brunson,,,Dana Brunson,dbrunson@internet2.edu,000548697,05/19/2021,,Principal Investigator,Scott,Yockel,,,Scott Yockel,syockel@g.harvard.edu,000753904,05/19/2021,,Co-Principal Investigator,Patrick,Schmitz,,,Patrick Schmitz,pschmitz@internet2.edu,000764398,05/19/2021,,Co-Principal Investigator,Claire,Mizumoto,E,,Claire E Mizumoto,claire@ucsd.edu,000829737,05/19/2021,,Co-Principal Investigator,INTERNET2,WASHINGTON,200363846,7349134264,1150 18TH ST NW,STE 900,United States,District of Columbia,DC,00,DC00,DZEBKFRD1ZN6,UNIVERSITY CORPORATION FOR ADVANCED INTERNET DEVELOPMENT,,Internet2,Washington,DC,200363825,1150 18th St NW,US,United States,District of Columbia,1,00,DC00,7231,CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE,9102,"WOMEN, MINORITY, DISABLED, NEC",0121,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,01002122DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2021~1497243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.&lt;br/&gt;             &lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory. Recently, theorems and advances have been made in noncommutative algebra through techniques in noncommutative function theory, complex analysis, and operator theory. Objects of interest will be noncommutative rational functions and how their evaluations on matrices and operators reveals algebraic information about the functions and the skew field they generate; there is a strong connection between the injectivity domains of noncommutative rational mappings, the invertibility sets of their Jacobian matrices, and whether the noncommutative rational mapping induces an automorphism of the free skew field. On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis. Employment of novel ideas from noncommutative algebra and noncommutative function theory will provide new insights into the study of optimal polynomial approximants and related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",08/02/2022,08/02/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155033,Meric,Augat,L,,Meric L Augat,maugat@wustl.edu,000838246,08/02/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Washington University,SAINT LOUIS,631304862,3147474134,ONE BROOKINGS DR,,United States,Missouri,MO,01,MO01,L6NFUM28LQM5,"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, THE",L6NFUM28LQM5,Washington University,,MO,631304899,,US,United States,Missouri,1,01,MO01,1281,ANALYSIS PROGRAM,,,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~110448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CAS: Quantifying the Systematic Catalytic Surface Chemistry of Non-Noble Metal Intermetallic Compounds to Achieve Diol and Olefin Production in Polyol Deoxygenation Reactions,NSF,08/01/2022,07/31/2025,353295.00,353295,Standard Grant,03090000,MPS,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,CHE,Division Of Chemistry,Laura Anderson,laanders@nsf.gov,7032922934,"With the support of the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Division of Chemistry, Siris Laursen of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville is developing inexpensive, earth-abundant catalysts for the valorization of waste from biomass pyrolysis and bio-diesel production. The future of a fully integrated biorefinery is contingent upon the efficient and selective conversion of all parts of biomass to value-added compounds. Dr. Laursen and his team are studying non-noble metal intermetallic compounds as catalysts to selectively form diols and olefins (building block chemicals) from water waste streams generated during biomass processing. These catalysts will be tuned in an effort to provide greater activity for the removal of oxygen atoms from the waste products, lower activity for carbon-carbon bond fragmentation, and lower activity for olefin hydrogenation. Simultaneously, a general understanding of the composition-activity relationships of the catalysts is being developed to improve predictive performance, accelerate catalyst discovery, and advance catalyst sustainability. This research project is expected to impact K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education by integrating students directly into the research group through summer experiences to build an educated workforce to support new renewable chemicals industries. Institutional programs are being used to support the inclusivity of these experiences and to identify students who may benefit the most from these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-noble intermetallic compounds are compositionally ordered solids composed of transition metals and post-transition metals or semimetals that have exhibited promising properties for the partial or complete deoxygenation of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol and propene. Siris Laursen and his research group are utilizing a combination of quantum chemical surface reaction modeling and experimental investigations to determine the composition-activity relationships of these compositionally complex catalysts and accelerate the discovery of materials that can produce valuable chemicals from polyols. Specific ranges of surface chemistry that promote the partial and complete removal of oxygens from polyols to produce valuable diols and olefins are being determined. Likewise, catalyst compositions that exhibit more aggressive surface chemistry to drive the complete breakdown of polyols to produce hydrogen (H2) and CO are also being noted. By understanding the origin of the special surface chemistry of intermetallic compounds at the atomic and electronic levels, Dr. Laursen and his students are working to develop simple fundamental design rules for non-noble metal catalysts that may be used in a wide range of chemical transformations that still lack efficient catalytic materials. Moreover, by integrating research and education, this project is promoting the education of a diverse group of future scientists and building an educated workforce for the biorefinery sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",07/22/2022,07/22/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155037,Siris,Laursen,O,,Siris O Laursen,slaursen@utk.edu,000644004,07/22/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Tennessee Knoxville,Knoxville,379163801,8659743466,1331 CIR PARK DR,,United States,Tennessee,TN,02,TN02,FN2YCS2YAUW3,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE,FN2YCS2YAUW3,University of Tennessee Knoxville,Knoxville,TN,379163801,1331 Circle Park Dr,US,United States,Tennessee,1,02,TN02,6884,Chemical Catalysis,090Z,CAS-Critical Aspects of Sustainability,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~353295,8037,Advanced Manufacturing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) Reaction-Enabled Synthesis  of Structurally Elaborate, Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds",NSF,09/01/2022,08/31/2025,525000.00,525000,Standard Grant,03090000,MPS,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,CHE,Division Of Chemistry,Paul Blakemore,pblakemo@nsf.gov,7032922726,"With the support of the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Thomas Hoye of the University of Minnesota is studying the use of a versatile new method for chemical synthesis known as the hexadehydro-Diels-Alder (HDDA) reaction. The HDDA reaction requires merely the simple heating of an appropriately designed precursor (a reactant known as a triyne) to produce a highly reactive species known as a benzyne. In turn, this intermediate can engage myriad types of “trapping agents,” often resulting in unprecedented types of chemical transformation. The funded research focuses on using the HDDA reaction as a tool to discover new ways to build molecules known as polycyclic aromatics. Compounds of this class often exhibit photochemical and photophysical properties critical for the operation of modern optoelectronic devices that are of great value to society; for example, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are used in energy efficient displays and lighting units, and photovoltaic cells, which are used for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. In addition to facilitating the preparation of polycyclic aromatics, pursuit of the project aims is anticipated to advance both fundamental understanding of various new types of chemical transformations as well as providing the means and inspiration to access previously elusive types of chemical structures. A number of significant broader impacts of benefit to a wider group of stakeholders – including students, instructors, and the broader scientific community – are planned. Of particular note are (1) an activity dubbed “Vignettes in Physical Organic Chemistry” in which Professor Hoye and his coworkers will prepare (and make available on a curated website) pedagogically valuable documents of historically important developments in the field of mechanistic organic chemistry, and (2) the development and dissemination of tutorial tips and tricks of practical value to the users of NMR spectroscopy, the single most valuable and powerful tool for analyzing organic reactions and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is enabling the Hoye research group to continue to capitalize on the capacity of the HDDA reaction to facilitate concise and efficient elaborations of highly conjugated polycyclic aromatics. The new methods and strategies for the syntheses of such compounds are the most important outcomes that are anticipated to result from this project but fundamentally important mechanistic knowledge will likely also emerge. Specific topics to be explored include naphthalene- and anthracene-templated HDDA reactions, intra-annular HDDA reactions, “propagating HDDA reactions” for the synthesis of conjugated polymers, and the use of an iterative exponential growth strategy to produce discreet polyyne substrates designed to undergo long sequences of “domino HDDA reactions” leading to oligomeric linear polyacenes. Professor Hoye holds major teaching awards that recognize his career-long commitment to the education of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Broader activities supported by this project will benefit chemistry research students at multiple levels. The scientific advances have the possibility of opening new avenues for pursuit by materials scientists who use organic electronic and photonic compounds in the settings of light-emitting diodes, photovoltaics, and solar cells, applications that have a large potential for societal impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",07/05/2022,09/20/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155042,Thomas,Hoye,R,,Thomas R Hoye,hoye@umn.edu,000215643,07/05/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,MINNEAPOLIS,554552009,6126245599,200 OAK ST SE # 224,,United States,Minnesota,MN,05,MN05,KABJZBBJ4B54,REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,CB47L9C9MDX1,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,Minneapolis,MN,554550240,207 Pleasant St. SE,US,United States,Minnesota,1,05,MN05,6878,Chemical Synthesis,8037,Advanced Manufacturing,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~525000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lanthanide Ion Complexes with Viscosity- or Temperature-dependent Emission,NSF,09/01/2022,08/31/2025,485000.00,485000,Continuing Grant,03090000,MPS,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,CHE,Division Of Chemistry,Tingyu Li,tli@nsf.gov,7032924949,"In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanisms B and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Programs of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias and her research group at the University of Nevada, Reno, will isolate lanthanide ion complexes capable of metal-centered light emission. They plan to demonstrate that this light emission can be modulated by viscosity and temperature and they will study the compound design features that best enable this modulation.  With the ability to correlate the intensity of the emitted light with the temperature and the viscosity, the group will be able to measure the temperature and viscosity inside of the cells. These properties vary with the type of cell and are important properties to help in the diagnosis of disease and in the unraveling of cell metabolism.  The research is also of interest in the management of industrial processes, such as monitoring completion of polymerization and hydrogelation processes.  During the project, undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars will be trained in the synthesis and spectroscopic techniques needed to successfully complete the proposed work. As part of the commitment to support the advancement and inclusivity of underrepresented minority faculty, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias will continue mentoring junior colleagues and promoting their science through a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, the Periodic TableTalks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lanthanide ions display sharp emission profile. This emission, which arises from transitions within the 4f orbitals, is most efficiently sensitized through coordinated ligand chromophores. These chromophores can be designed to display an energy transfer to the emissive lanthanide ion, which is modulated by viscosity and temperature. In this project, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias and her research group propose to isolate several new ligands, based on N-heterocycles and cyanovinyl molecular rotors, and to assess their ability to promote metal-ion centered emission as a function of the temperature and viscosity of the medium. In addition, they will study, by using heteroleptic complexes, which ligand functionalities enable the viscosity- and temperature-dependent emission through a two-photon excitation process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",04/04/2022,08/06/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155047,Ana,de Bettencourt-Dias,,,Ana de Bettencourt-Dias,abd@unr.edu,000488789,04/04/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno",RENO,895570001,7757844040,1664 N VIRGINIA ST,,United States,Nevada,NV,02,NV02,WLDGTNCFFJZ3,NEVADA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION,E2N7LVJCNCW8,"Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of Nevada, Reno",Reno,NV,895570001,1664 North Virginia Street,US,United States,Nevada,1,02,NV02,6880,Chemical Measurement & Imaging,7234,SENSORS NON-SOLICITATION RESEA,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~485000,9150,EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES,9102,"Chem Struct,Dynmcs&Mechansms B",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is, for instance, the case for the equations of General Relativity, Plasma Physics, Atmosphere and Ocean Science, Nonlinear optics. While these systems are very different in many respects, the common mathematical features are responsible for similar behaviors. The phenomena that the project will investigate are, on the one hand, solitary waves, and on the other hand, wave turbulence. In the case of waves on a surface of water, think of tsunami for the former (a rigid behavior), and disordered ripples for the latter (a chaotic behavior). The aim of this project is to investigate these phenomena, which have many applications to basic science and technology. The project will also provide research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will reach a deeper understanding of two basic features of nonlinear dispersive equations: solitary waves and wave turbulence. For the former, the distorted Fourier transform will be used to analyze the stability of solitary waves, in particular their nonlinear resonances (in the sense of dynamical systems), leading to possibly optimal stability results. For the latter, the progress will be twofold: on the derivation of the kinetic description of wave turbulence, and on the analysis of the kinetic equation describing wave turbulence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",04/06/2022,04/06/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155050,Pierre,Germain,,,Pierre Germain,pmg7@nyu.edu,000575442,04/06/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New York University,NEW YORK,100121019,2129982121,70 WASHINGTON SQ S,,United States,New York,NY,10,NY10,NX9PXMKW5KW8,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,,New York University,New York,NY,100121019,251 Mercer St,US,United States,New York,1,10,NY10,1281,ANALYSIS PROGRAM,1281,ANALYSIS PROGRAM,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~319377,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will be achieved by the design of new organometallic catalysts that provide a high degree of control over the three-dimensional structure of the product molecules. Organometallic catalysts are carbon- and metal-containing substances that, when added in trace amounts to a reaction mixture, speed up the conversion of starting materials to products. Catalysts permit lower reaction temperatures, thereby minimizing energy input and the associated production of green-house gases. In addition, catalysts prevent the formation of undesired byproducts and their associated negative environmental impacts. Novel approaches for the controlled generation of proposed intermediates will advance our understanding of a relatively unexplored but important area of hydrocarbon chemistry. The proposed research will contribute to future advances in the eco-friendly preparation of organic molecules with useful properties.

It is anticipated that these studies will lay a foundation for the development of new catalysts that facilitate challenging reactions that involve highly delocalized, nonpolar transition-state structures. The catalyst design innovations include metal catalysts with a facial array of three accessible metal coordination sites for the simultaneous interaction of the metal with three pi-bonds. Low temperature spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and computational studies will be utilized to reveal how hexadentate coordination perturbs polyene structures and induces disrotatory triene ring closure. By employing a chiral ancillary ligand, enantioselective electrocyclization will be targeted. Studies into metal-catalyzed electrocyclization will unlock new retro-synthetic approaches for the synthesis of complex biologically active compounds, designer ligands, and new materials.

In artificial photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy through generation of clean fuels such as hydrogen. Water serves as a source of electrons and protons for fuel forming reaction but its splitting into hydrogen and oxygen requires rearrangement of chemical bonds at high potential. Molecular catalysts which contain earth-abundant iron, cobalt and manganese can facilitate water splitting by lowering the potential and, thus, boosting energy conversion efficiencies.  The development of artificial photosynthesis and its large-scale implementation is expected to address the energy needs of modern society and facilitate transition to a CO2 neutral economy. This research lies at the interface of physics, chemistry and materials science, with results expected to impact diverse fields and contribute to fundamental science, education, environment and national energy security.

Heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions on metal surfaces seem superficially straightforward, yet subtle details may dominate because of the heterogeneity of the surfaces. These key details are often obscured, rendering accurate atomic-level descriptions elusive for even a ‘simple’ reaction like CO oxidation to CO2.  Illuminating these atomic-level details about heterogeneously catalyzed reactions is expected to contribute to advances in the utilization of scarce resources and to a reduction in the generation of environmentally harmful byproducts. In conjunction with the surface chemistry aspect, this project will offer scientific research opportunities to under-represented socioeconomic groups in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) through various outreach efforts: the high school lab, tours of LUC facilities, and a summer internship program.  Additional engagement and outreach efforts will include hosting CPS student meetings with admissions counselors from local universities and trips to Argonne National Laboratory.

It turns out that many questions in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation.

Central to this research is a recent discovery made by the Majireck research group that reactive compounds known as N-quaternized ketene N,O-acetals, typically too delicate to be handled, can be prepared in a manner that stabilizes them. This important finding opens the door for such materials to be employed for the first time in the synthesis of a broad range of valuable compounds. For example, a goal of the funded project is to use the newly available class of N,O-acetals for the preparation of biologically active nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds commonly found as components in active pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the research team will investigate a variety of processes involving the new reagents to uncover efficient methods for chemical manufacture that are straightforward and devoid of expensive additives, such as precious metal catalysts. The broader impacts of the project will extend to supporting research-based academic courses and summer research experiences for undergraduate students in synthetic organic chemistry at Hamilton College, with an emphasis on recruiting, training, and retaining students from underrepresented groups for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N-Quaternized ketene N,O-acetals have been overlooked as reagents in organic synthesis due to their typical instability and/or specialized means of generation in situ. However, it was recently discovered that certain compounds within this class, and particularly pyridinium ketene N,O-acetals, have long-term bench-stability that allows for their preparation and purification in a straightforward manner. This opens up the possibility of leveraging N-quaternized ketene N,O-acetals as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. For example, such compounds can act as a source of thermally-generated O-alkyl ketenium ions, which can be used in acid catalyst-free Friedel-Crafts acylations, or in various cycloaddition reactions.

The future of a fully integrated biorefinery is contingent upon the efficient and selective conversion of all parts of biomass to value-added compounds. Dr. Laursen and his team are studying non-noble metal intermetallic compounds as catalysts to selectively form diols and olefins (building block chemicals) from water waste streams generated during biomass processing. These catalysts will be tuned in an effort to provide greater activity for the removal of oxygen atoms from the waste products, lower activity for carbon-carbon bond fragmentation, and lower activity for olefin hydrogenation. Simultaneously, a general understanding of the composition-activity relationships of the catalysts is being developed to improve predictive performance, accelerate catalyst discovery, and advance catalyst sustainability. This research project is expected to impact K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education by integrating students directly into the research group through summer experiences to build an educated workforce to support new renewable chemicals industries. Institutional programs are being used to support the inclusivity of these experiences and to identify students who may benefit the most from these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-noble intermetallic compounds are compositionally ordered solids composed of transition metals and post-transition metals or semimetals that have exhibited promising properties for the partial or complete deoxygenation of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol and propene. Siris Laursen and his research group are utilizing a combination of quantum chemical surface reaction modeling and experimental investigations to determine the composition-activity relationships of these compositionally complex catalysts and accelerate the discovery of materials that can produce valuable chemicals from polyols. Specific ranges of surface chemistry that promote the partial and complete removal of oxygens from polyols to produce valuable diols and olefins are being determined. Likewise, catalyst compositions that exhibit more aggressive surface chemistry to drive the complete breakdown of polyols to produce hydrogen (H2) and CO are also being noted. By understanding the origin of the special surface chemistry of intermetallic compounds at the atomic and electronic levels, Dr. Laursen and his students are working to develop simple fundamental design rules for non-noble metal catalysts that may be used in a wide range of chemical transformations that still lack efficient catalytic materials. Moreover, by integrating research and education, this project is promoting the education of a diverse group of future scientists and building an educated workforce for the biorefinery sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",07/22/2022,07/22/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155037,Siris,Laursen,O,,Siris O Laursen,slaursen@utk.edu,000644004,07/22/2022,,Principal Investigator,Nicholas,Feamster,G,,Nicholas G Feamster,feamster@uchicago.edu,000489704,07/29/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Tennessee Knoxville,Knoxville,379163801,8659743466,1331 CIR PARK DR,,United States,Tennessee,TN,02,TN02,FN2YCS2YAUW3,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE,FN2YCS2YAUW3,University of Tennessee Knoxville,Knoxville,TN,379163801,1331 Circle Park Dr,US,United States,Tennessee,1,02,TN02,6884,Chemical Catalysis,090Z,CAS-Critical Aspects of Sustainability,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~353295,8037,Advanced Manufacturing,8060,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,,025Z,SaTC: Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace,7923,SMALL PROJECT,,,"SaTC: CORE: Small: Understanding Practical Deployment Considerations for Decentralized, Encrypted DNS",NSF,08/01/2022,07/31/2025,500000.00,500000,Standard Grant,05050000,CSE,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr,CNS,Division Of Computer and Network Systems,Alexander Sprintson,asprints@nsf.gov,7032922170,"The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet protocol and system that maps human-readable names to Internet protocol addresses; it is central to every Internet activity, from web browsing to video streaming. Despite the central role of the DNS in essentially all Internet communications, until recently it has been unencrypted, which has introduced significant privacy risks and vulnerabilities. In recent years, technology to encrypt DNS queries and responses includes transmitting DNS queries and responses. This project is studying the performance and privacy properties of existing encrypted DNS protocols such as DoH and DoT, towards the ultimate goal of deploying applications and systems that use these new protocols to improve user privacy and provide users satisfactory performance.  The Internet is rapidly moving towards encrypted DNS protocols, with encrypted DNS now either available or enabled by default in many standard Internet browsers and Internet-connected embedded devices.  Yet, there is relatively little knowledge or agreement about the performance and privacy characteristics of such protocols.  This project builds on the early work in this area to develop comprehensive techniques for evaluating both the performance and privacy of new network applications, systems, and architectures that rely on encrypted DNS protocols.  The research will contribute to the larger body of knowledge on both DNS performance and privacy, and the available performance and evaluation frameworks for evaluating encrypted DNS protocols will be released to the community to allow others to continue to build on these results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first theme of this project seeks to understand the performance implications of existing encrypted DNS protocols and architectures, on DNS lookup time, as well as on the performance of popular Internet applications whose performance depends on the DNS, particularly for metrics such as web page load time.  Understanding why (and when) encrypted DNS outperforms unencrypted DNS---as well as when it does not---will ultimately shed light on how to best architect DNS resolution to ensure both confidentiality and good performance. The second theme of this project recognizes that encrypting DNS need not imply centralization. Distributing a client's DNS queries across multiple recursive resolvers may improve reliability, privacy, and even performance, although such improvements will ultimately require the design of appropriate strategies for distributing these queries. This theme explores the prospect of re-decentralizing the DNS.  Third, the project is coalescing various approaches to DNS privacy---from DNS encryption to previous work on oblivious DNS (ODNS)---into a coherent architectural framework. This theme explores how and where DNS privacy extensions could be deployed (e.g., in a local DNS resolver, in a web browser) to both preserve user privacy and preserve a seamless user experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",07/29/2022,07/29/2022,,Grant,47.070,1,4900,4900,2155128,University of Chicago,CHICAGO,606375418,7737028669,5801 S ELLIS AVE,,United States,Illinois,IL,01,IL01,ZUE9HKT2CLC9,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,ZUE9HKT2CLC9,The University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,606372612,5730 South Ellis Avenue,US,United States,Illinois,1,01,IL01,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To protect against unauthorized access, many authentication methods (e.g., PINs, fingerprints, and face IDs) have been deployed. However, by requiring active user efforts to input biometric data, they are unable to cope with many scenarios when user participation is not available at once, such as when the smartphone is shared with others or when notification content is displayed on the screen spontaneously. Furthermore, while biometric data have become more popular for authentication, it can be eavesdropped and reused. This research addresses the two long-standing issues of biometric authentication, obtrusiveness and replay threat, based on gripping-hand sensing. The key insight is that for a handheld device, the user needs to hold the device to use it. The project’s novelties are enabling smartphone users to solve access issues with their own hands unobtrusively, extracting nonreusable biometric features for authentication, and using media sounds to sense the user’s gripping hand. The project's broader significance and importance are that it benefits the huge population of smartphone users by providing enhanced mobile security, disseminates the research outcomes to the public to benefit both industry and academia, and contributes to educational programs, including curriculum development, graduate/undergraduate training, K-12 involvement, and underrepresented student engagement in research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project advances the knowledge of mobile device security and privacy. It explores a novel gripping-hand biometric for user identification, which is readily available to acquire visually or acoustically from mobile device users. Deep learning-based algorithms are developed to derive unique biometric features and distinguish people’s hands. The project further devises a technique based on modulated stimulus signals to encode biometric features into each non-repeated biometric code for challenge-response user authentication. Moreover, cross-domain user authentication methods are developed, which leverage commonly used smartphone audio signals (e.g., ringtones) to sense and recognize a user’s gripping hand rather than using dedicated signals. The hard-to-forge physical relationships between the resulting acoustic and vibration responses of such audio signals are explored for achieving replay resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",06/10/2022,06/10/2022,,Grant,47.070,1,4900,4900,2155131,Chen,Wang,,,Chen Wang,chenwang1@lsu.edu,000817720,06/10/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Louisiana State University,BATON ROUGE,708030001,2255782760,202 HIMES HALL,,United States,Louisiana,LA,06,LA06,ECQEYCHRNKJ4,LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY,Z7ZNZH7LJ778,Louisiana State University and A&M College,Baton Rouge,LA,708032701,,US,United States,Louisiana,1,06,LA06,8060,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,025Z,SaTC: Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~471429,7923,SMALL PROJECT,,,,9150,EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hull of the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) is studying a palladium- and iron-catalyzed process that converts simple chemical feedstocks (olefins) into value-added products. This so-called ""nucleoboration"" method results in the addition of an atom of boron and one of another element, typically nitrogen, to the olefin in a finely controlled manner. Selective transformations exist to subsequently convert the boron atom into a wide variety of other substituents and the overall process promises to be a versatile approach for the manufacture of complex compounds and advanced materials of value to society. In combination with method development, the funded research encompasses detailed mechanistic studies designed to elucidate how the catalyst pair functions with the goals of advancing fundamental knowledge of transition metal-based catalysis and improving the efficiency and sustainability of chemical synthesis. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr. Hull and her coworkers engage in an extensive range of educational and outreach activities, including: the ChemBridge program to improve the college readiness of young Texans who belong to groups underserved in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, and ongoing efforts to propagate shared values of diversity, equity, and inclusivity among the faculty and students of UT-Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funded research focuses on investigations of a recently discovered Pd/Fe-cocatalyzed aminoboration of alkenes and it features further development of the process (e.g., to expand both the substrate and nucleophile scope) and associated mechanistic studies to gain insights for the underlying role of the iron(II) triflate cocatalyst. Specifically, during the course of methodological development (Aim 1), reaction conditions for the successful aminoboration of norbornene [key reagents: PhthNH, B2Pin2, cat. Pd(MeCN)2Cl2, cat. Fe(OTf)2, and O2] will be further explored and extended to more challenging olefin substrates for which beta-hydride elimination following the Markovnikov addition stage of the process could be encountered. Nucleophiles other than N-based systems, such as O-based (e.g., phenols), S-based (e.g., thiols), and C-based (e.g., indoles), will also be investigated as will alternative transmetalation reagents (e.g., Si- and Sn-based) to potentially arrive upon a highly generalized nucleometallation process. In further efforts to broaden the versatility of the platform yet further, a remote nucleoboration transformation that incorporates a 'Pd-walking' stage (i.e., regioisomerization) prior to transmetalation is also being pursued. In mechanistic studies (Aim 2), the origin of the critical role for iron species in the transmetalation step of aminoboration is being explored as is its equally curious beneficial effect on the aza-Wacker process. Finally, in an effort to develop a more sustainable variant of the nucleoboration process (Aim 3), a heterogenous and recyclable Pd/Fe catalyst system is under development. All told, the studies being pursued are anticipated to extend the versatility of olefin difunctionalization chemistry and in so doing, facilitate the synthesis of important classes of nitrogen (and other heteroatom) containing compounds that are prominent among active pharmaceutical ingredients and other kinds of complex molecules of utility in science, engineering, and medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",06/22/2022,06/22/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155133,Kami,Hull,,,Kami Hull,kamihull@utexas.edu,000647938,06/22/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Texas at Austin,AUSTIN,787121139,5124716424,110 INNER CAMPUS DR,,United States,Texas,TX,25,TX25,V6AFQPN18437,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN,X5NKD2NFF2V3,University of Texas at Austin,Austin,TX,787595316,"3925 W Braker Lane, Ste 3.340",US,United States,Texas,1,10,TX10,6884,Chemical Catalysis,8037,Advanced Manufacturing,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~500000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many chemical reactions proceed faster when energy is added, usually in the form of increased temperature. Adding heat allows molecules to adopt high-energy configurations from which they can convert into other molecules. In the macroscopic world, energy is a smoothly varying property. However, molecules are small in an absolute sense, and their energy levels are determined by quantum mechanics. A CO2 molecule is 50 billionths of a centimeter in length, and it has discrete energy levels when it rotates and when its atoms vibrate internally. These quantized energy states control the types of molecular motion that help, or hinder, chemical change under high-energy conditions. The importance of the project is to determine how molecular geometry is distorted by large amounts of rotational energy and how this distortion leads to new types of chemical processes. The results of this project will have implications for understanding chemical reactions and are expected to inform research in other fields where high energy molecules are present. Graduate students will have the opportunity to gain experience in sophisticated laser-based approaches.

Chemical reactions are often performed in solvents that are toxic and/or environmentally unfriendly. Thus, there are a number of reasons why reducing solvent use could be of advantage. This project addresses the problem by developing a mechanical approach (mechanochemistry) to run chemical reactions with little or no solvent. Mechanochemistry involves grinding solid reactants together so that they are in intimate contact and the milling process provides the energy required to initiate and maintain the reaction between reactants. Mechanochemistry is a relatively undeveloped area and this research will work to find optimal conditions for such reactions.  Targeted products include biodegradable polymers, a class of compounds of broad academic and industrial interests. Students involved in this project will gain insight and experience in mechanochemical methodology, a significant departure from the solvent-based orientation of most synthetic chemistry approaches. In addition, Professor Hanusa works closely with the Fisk-Vanderbilt Masters-to-Ph.D. Bridge Program, which is designed to broaden the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in science through partnerships between Vanderbilt and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study how the introduction of small amounts of liquid—too little to dissolve the reagents—influences mechanochemical reaction outcomes.

Both main-group and transition metal coordination complexes and organometallic compounds will be studied. The research will also examine the effect of the lattice structures of solid reagents on mechanochemical reactivity. In addition to training of students, the project will provide educational and outreach efforts for women, members of underserved groups, and middle and high school students.

The HDDA reaction requires merely the simple heating of an appropriately designed precursor (a reactant known as a triyne) to produce a highly reactive species known as a benzyne. In turn, this intermediate can engage myriad types of “trapping agents,” often resulting in unprecedented types of chemical transformation. The funded research focuses on using the HDDA reaction as a tool to discover new ways to build molecules known as polycyclic aromatics. Compounds of this class often exhibit photochemical and photophysical properties critical for the operation of modern optoelectronic devices that are of great value to society; for example, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are used in energy efficient displays and lighting units, and photovoltaic cells, which are used for the conversion of solar energy into electricity. In addition to facilitating the preparation of polycyclic aromatics, pursuit of the project aims is anticipated to advance both fundamental understanding of various new types of chemical transformations as well as providing the means and inspiration to access previously elusive types of chemical structures. A number of significant broader impacts of benefit to a wider group of stakeholders – including students, instructors, and the broader scientific community – are planned. Of particular note are (1) an activity dubbed “Vignettes in Physical Organic Chemistry” in which Professor Hoye and his coworkers will prepare (and make available on a curated website) pedagogically valuable documents of historically important developments in the field of mechanistic organic chemistry, and (2) the development and dissemination of tutorial tips and tricks of practical value to the users of NMR spectroscopy, the single most valuable and powerful tool for analyzing organic reactions and structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is enabling the Hoye research group to continue to capitalize on the capacity of the HDDA reaction to facilitate concise and efficient elaborations of highly conjugated polycyclic aromatics. The new methods and strategies for the syntheses of such compounds are the most important outcomes that are anticipated to result from this project but fundamentally important mechanistic knowledge will likely also emerge. Specific topics to be explored include naphthalene- and anthracene-templated HDDA reactions, intra-annular HDDA reactions, “propagating HDDA reactions” for the synthesis of conjugated polymers, and the use of an iterative exponential growth strategy to produce discreet polyyne substrates designed to undergo long sequences of “domino HDDA reactions” leading to oligomeric linear polyacenes.

These complexes are highly luminescent and the luminescence properties can be controlled by the structures of these complexes. Such molecular strings also have the potential to serve as conducting molecular wires and coils for applications in miniaturized electronic devices on the submicroscopic scale. Luminescent complexes with multiple copper, silver, and gold ions are of particular interest in this regard, since they can be applied in molecular/organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). For the construction of molecular strings of this nature, tailored synthetic methodologies are required to target and control linear arrangements of the individual metal ions. Stollenz and his group will work to develop a new methodology for producing not only strictly linear arrays of copper, silver, and gold ions, but also arrangements that are substantially bent and therefore represent molecular coils. The major goal is to investigate how the structural changes affect the emission properties of these compounds. A long-term prospect for such molecular coils, if embedded in electronic circuits, is to utilize them as tiny electromagnets that can be integrated in nanomachines and other nanoscaled electronic devices. Such devices can in turn be applied in nanorobots that deliver drugs inside a human body. If these devices are luminescent, their path can be followed by fluorescence imaging. The broader impacts of this work will include the mentoring and training of undergraduate and masters students from the significant population of underserved groups at Kennesaw State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program focuses on the development and implementation of new strategies to multinuclear coinage metal arrays as molecular strings and coils that serve as key components in molecular/organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The underlying synthetic methods aim to provide a fundamental approach to control aggregation of linear cluster assemblies and to provide a insight into the coordination chemistry of multinuclear complex arrays in general. Specifically, a library of new bis(amidine) ligands that are capable of accommodating at least four copper centers, arranged in a linear fashion, are being targeted. The incorporation of Cu(I) ions will be accomplished by employing a clean organometallic Cu(I) source, mesitylcopper. Bis(amidine) ligands with additional terminal N-donor groups will be selectively protected by MR (M = Cu, Ag, Au; R = Cl, Mes) complex fragments. These hitherto unknown dinuclear metalloligands will be utilized as building blocks for new linear or bundled homonuclear Cu(I) or heterobimetallic Cu(I)/Ag(I) or Cu(I)/Au(I) cluster assemblies with promise as luminescent materials. Finally, this program will provide in-depth training of undergraduate/graduate research students and postdocs in synthesis, characterization techniques (crystallography and spectroscopy), oral presentation skills, scientific writing, laboratory safety, and data management.

They plan to demonstrate that this light emission can be modulated by viscosity and temperature and they will study the compound design features that best enable this modulation.  With the ability to correlate the intensity of the emitted light with the temperature and the viscosity, the group will be able to measure the temperature and viscosity inside of the cells. These properties vary with the type of cell and are important properties to help in the diagnosis of disease and in the unraveling of cell metabolism.  The research is also of interest in the management of industrial processes, such as monitoring completion of polymerization and hydrogelation processes.  During the project, undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars will be trained in the synthesis and spectroscopic techniques needed to successfully complete the proposed work.

This emission, which arises from transitions within the 4f orbitals, is most efficiently sensitized through coordinated ligand chromophores.

In this project, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias and her research group propose to isolate several new ligands, based on N-heterocycles and cyanovinyl molecular rotors, and to assess their ability to promote metal-ion centered emission as a function of the temperature and viscosity of the medium.

High Performance Computing (HPC) is an important element, however RCD has expanded well beyond HPC into secure enclaves for data compliance; big data management, analytics, and movement; AI/machine learning; and more recently into heterogeneous compute models, edge computing, and cloud-based computing. Researchers are struggling to keep pace with the explosion of data and the rapid evolution of computing resources, and often lack the skills to make full use of emerging tools and techniques. Developing and maintaining the needed expertise takes valuable time from research and is often beyond the capacity of researchers; they must depend upon partners (RCD professionals) who combine technology expertise and an understanding of research workflows and researcher needs. Institutions face challenges recruiting and retaining RCD professional staff, and building effective RCD support services. This CI CoE Demonstration Pilot (RCD CoE) will develop an RCD Resource and Career Center to advance and enable the nation's capacity for computational and data-intensive research by providing institutions and individuals the products, tools, services, and community to build and sustain successful RCD operations.  The project will also provide expertise in the development of new RCD professionals, and provide a voice and a connector for the broad community and the profession at large. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The RCD Resource and Career Center will build upon work that the NSF-supported Campus Research Computing Consortium (CaRCC) has done and continues to do to develop products and tools for effective RCD support. The Center will develop a robust and sustainable implementation of the RCD Capabilities Model that provides an assessment framework, support for benchmarking and strategic planning, and a community data set to understand the landscape of RCD support. The Center will expand and disseminate resources for RCD Professionalization, including support for adoption of an RCD Job Family Matrix to properly classify RCD professional roles and conducting a national census of RCD Professionals to characterize the current state of RCD staff and programs. The Center will create and disseminate a model of Career Arcs for RCD Professionals to explain career options and help existing RCD professionals explore professional development and advancement. Work in the project will aggregate resources for staff training and workforce development, including leading practices for recruitment, onboarding, advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and professional development, as well as proven models for student internship and training programs.

This will be achieved by the design of new organometallic catalysts that provide a high degree of control over the three-dimensional structure of the product molecules. Organometallic catalysts are carbon- and metal-containing substances that, when added in trace amounts to a reaction mixture, speed up the conversion of starting materials to products. Catalysts permit lower reaction temperatures, thereby minimizing energy input and the associated production of green-house gases. In addition, catalysts prevent the formation of undesired byproducts and their associated negative environmental impacts. Novel approaches for the controlled generation of proposed intermediates will advance our understanding of a relatively unexplored but important area of hydrocarbon chemistry.

This theory is also a natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in this picture. Groups also model symmetries of physical systems and mathematical structures, and since their formal introduction in the 19th century, their applications have expanded deep into almost every major area of mathematics. Representation theory of groups provides canonical ways to assign operator algebras to a given group, hence establishes a bridge between the two theories which allows one to import ideas and concepts from one theory to the other. The study of the connections between groups and their associated operator algebras has been a central part of operator algebra theory since the time of von Neumann, and it has had tremendous impact on both theories, as well as in several other related areas such as ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and representation theory. This project aims to make further progress in this direction by discovering new connections between structural properties of groups and their operator algebras. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the project is aimed at several conjectures and problems related to new operator-algebraic rigidity phenomena for discrete groups in terms of their C*-algebras. This is based on a new approach to extending important classical results from ergodic theory of higher rank groups to the operator-algebraic setting. The main concept of interest is that of invariant subalgebras of C*-algebras generated by unitary representations, which are viewed as non-commutative generalizations of normal subgroups. The boundary theory of groups (in the sense of Furstenberg) plays a central role in the Principal Investigator’s strategies to approach the proposed problems. Furstenberg's boundary theory has been, in the past few decades, a major tool in ergodic theory of higher rank lattices and in proving their rigidity properties.

In artificial photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy through generation of clean fuels such as hydrogen. Water serves as a source of electrons and protons for fuel forming reaction but its splitting into hydrogen and oxygen requires rearrangement of chemical bonds at high potential. Molecular catalysts which contain earth-abundant iron, cobalt and manganese can facilitate water splitting by lowering the potential and, thus, boosting energy conversion efficiencies.  The development of artificial photosynthesis and its large-scale implementation is expected to address the energy needs of modern society and facilitate transition to a CO2 neutral economy. This research lies at the interface of physics, chemistry and materials science, with results expected to impact diverse fields and contribute to fundamental science, education, environment and national energy security. Planned research and educational activities are designed to increase participation of under-represented students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, improve experiences of female students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), enhance training of students via integration of research results into curriculum and to deliver teaching modules to schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research in this project focuses on the complex multielectron chemical process of artificial photosynthesis. Among the goals is the development of new and detailed studies of known Fe-based molecular water oxidation catalysts. In situ spectroscopic characterization of intermediates in catalytic water oxidation using Fe systems will inform future design of more active and stable catalysts. Advanced spectroscopic techniques such as synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray emission, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and multi-wavelength kinetic resonance Raman will be used to uncover mechanism of O-O bond formation in these catalysts. The relationship between molecular structure and catalytic activity will be uncovered experimentally and further analyzed computationally using density functional theory (DFT).

Key to advancing the science of chemical synthesis is the design and application of new reactions for carbon–carbon (C–C) bond formation. The invention of new catalytic C–C bond forming reactions allows chemists to synthesize important molecules with increased efficiency – reducing the cost and resources required. Reisman and team will focus on the synthesis of natural products and, in particular, the complex structures of the selected target molecules pose challenges to the current state-of-the-art in catalysis, and provide a platform to invent, test, and refine new C–C bond forming reactions that can ultimately find applications in the synthesis of a broad range of molecules that can benefit society. The rigorous training of scientists in the theory, methods, and strategies of constructing organic molecules will be an essential part of the funded research studies. Undergraduate, graduate student and post-doctoral researchers trained through this research experience will be poised to pursue careers in the chemical, biotechnology, and materials science sectors.

Heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions on metal surfaces seem superficially straightforward, yet subtle details may dominate because of the heterogeneity of the surfaces. These key details are often obscured, rendering accurate atomic-level descriptions elusive for even a ‘simple’ reaction like CO oxidation to CO2.  Illuminating these atomic-level details about heterogeneously catalyzed reactions is expected to contribute to advances in the utilization of scarce resources and to a reduction in the generation of environmentally harmful byproducts. In conjunction with the surface chemistry aspect, this project will offer scientific research opportunities to under-represented socioeconomic groups in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) through various outreach efforts: the high school lab, tours of LUC facilities, and a summer internship program.  Additional engagement and outreach efforts will include hosting CPS student meetings with admissions counselors from local universities and trips to Argonne National Laboratory. Through these efforts, high school students from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods will gain exposure to science and learn about new educational opportunities and careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, Dan Killelea of Loyola University, Chicago and his team are working to uncover the connection between observed surface structures and reaction kinetics and mechanism for heterogeneous catalysis systems. Rhodium metal surfaces, which are representative of the late-transition metals, are reproducibly prepared with specific, well-characterized oxygenaceous phases. The effects of defect density and geometry on surface oxidation and chemistry will be systematically explored using a curved Rh(111) crystal. Structural data from scanning tunneling microscopy(STM)-imaging will be interpreted using input from density functional theory (DFT), which will also calculate the energetics of Osub. The data obtained will be complemented with ancillary surface science measurements. The reactivity and structural measurements collected at Loyola will identify the surface states and conditions for further study of CO oxidation.  These experiments will be conducted in Leiden (Netherlands) and Göttingen (Germany) with the reactive molecular-beam scattering with velocity resolved detection.

Imaging in cells and mammals using chemiluminescence offers significant advantages including low-cost, high sensitivity, low phototoxicity, and the ability to image in deeper tissue. This emerging technique for molecular imaging is limited, however, by a lack of methods for precise quantitative imaging of analytes and optimal microscopy instrumentation. The proposed study will advance the field of chemiluminescence sensing by progressing from rough relative measurements to precise quantitative imaging of a diverse set of analytes.

The future of a fully integrated biorefinery is contingent upon the efficient and selective conversion of all parts of biomass to value-added compounds. Dr. Laursen and his team are studying non-noble metal intermetallic compounds as catalysts to selectively form diols and olefins (building block chemicals) from water waste streams generated during biomass processing. These catalysts will be tuned in an effort to provide greater activity for the removal of oxygen atoms from the waste products, lower activity for carbon-carbon bond fragmentation, and lower activity for olefin hydrogenation. Simultaneously, a general understanding of the composition-activity relationships of the catalysts is being developed to improve predictive performance, accelerate catalyst discovery, and advance catalyst sustainability. This research project is expected to impact K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education by integrating students directly into the research group through summer experiences to build an educated workforce to support new renewable chemicals industries. Institutional programs are being used to support the inclusivity of these experiences and to identify students who may benefit the most from these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-noble intermetallic compounds are compositionally ordered solids composed of transition metals and post-transition metals or semimetals that have exhibited promising properties for the partial or complete deoxygenation of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol and propene. Siris Laursen and his research group are utilizing a combination of quantum chemical surface reaction modeling and experimental investigations to determine the composition-activity relationships of these compositionally complex catalysts and accelerate the discovery of materials that can produce valuable chemicals from polyols. Specific ranges of surface chemistry that promote the partial and complete removal of oxygens from polyols to produce valuable diols and olefins are being determined. Likewise, catalyst compositions that exhibit more aggressive surface chemistry to drive the complete breakdown of polyols to produce hydrogen (H2) and CO are also being noted.

Despite the central role of the DNS in essentially all Internet communications, until recently it has been unencrypted, which has introduced significant privacy risks and vulnerabilities. In recent years, technology to encrypt DNS queries and responses includes transmitting DNS queries and responses. This project is studying the performance and privacy properties of existing encrypted DNS protocols such as DoH and DoT, towards the ultimate goal of deploying applications and systems that use these new protocols to improve user privacy and provide users satisfactory performance.  The Internet is rapidly moving towards encrypted DNS protocols, with encrypted DNS now either available or enabled by default in many standard Internet browsers and Internet-connected embedded devices.  Yet, there is relatively little knowledge or agreement about the performance and privacy characteristics of such protocols.  This project builds on the early work in this area to develop comprehensive techniques for evaluating both the performance and privacy of new network applications, systems, and architectures that rely on encrypted DNS protocols.  The research will contribute to the larger body of knowledge on both DNS performance and privacy, and the available performance and evaluation frameworks for evaluating encrypted DNS protocols will be released to the community to allow others to continue to build on these results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first theme of this project seeks to understand the performance implications of existing encrypted DNS protocols and architectures, on DNS lookup time, as well as on the performance of popular Internet applications whose performance depends on the DNS, particularly for metrics such as web page load time.  Understanding why (and when) encrypted DNS outperforms unencrypted DNS---as well as when it does not---will ultimately shed light on how to best architect DNS resolution to ensure both confidentiality and good performance. The second theme of this project recognizes that encrypting DNS need not imply centralization. Distributing a client's DNS queries across multiple recursive resolvers may improve reliability, privacy, and even performance, although such improvements will ultimately require the design of appropriate strategies for distributing these queries. This theme explores the prospect of re-decentralizing the DNS.  Third, the project is coalescing various approaches to DNS privacy---from DNS encryption to previous work on oblivious DNS (ODNS)---into a coherent architectural framework. This theme explores how and where DNS privacy extensions could be deployed (e.g., in a local DNS resolver, in a web browser) to both preserve user privacy and preserve a seamless user experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",07/29/2022,07/29/2022,,Grant,47.070,1,4900,4900,2155128,University of Chicago,CHICAGO,606375418,7737028669,5801 S ELLIS AVE,,United States,Illinois,IL,01,IL01,ZUE9HKT2CLC9,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,ZUE9HKT2CLC9,The University of Chicago,Chicago,IL,606372612,5730 South Ellis Avenue,US,United States,Illinois,1,01,IL01,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~500000,1762,SOLID STATE & MATERIALS CHEMIS,,,,,,,,,,,8037,Advanced Manufacturing,,CAS: Understanding Structural Metamorphosis of Transition Metal Chalcogenide Electrocatalyst Interfaces,NSF,08/01/2022,07/31/2025,548308.00,379583,Continuing Grant,03090000,MPS,Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien,CHE,Division Of Chemistry,Kenneth Moloy,kmoloy@nsf.gov,7032928441,"With the support of the Chemical Catalysis (CAT) program in the Chemistry Division (CHE) and the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR), Manashi Nath and Xinhua Liang from Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology are studying the surface chemistry of transition metal chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts. The materials catalyze water electrolysis under reactive electrochemical conditions and understanding their fundamental activity is important to further improve them. Water electrolysis, also known as water splitting, is a promising way to produce hydrogen and oxygen. Electrochemically-produced hydrogen has significant potential for renewable energy. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the most challenging aspect to overcome in electrocatalytic water splitting. Although several highly active OER electrocatalysts have been discovered over the last few years, there remains a lack of understanding of the actual catalyst surface species responsible for their reactivity. In this project, the PIs will investigate an interesting and well-defined family of chalcogenide (selenide and telluride) electrocatalysts with high OER catalytic activity to diagnose their interfacial behavior. Apart from offering new insight about the active surface composition, the PIs will also (i) provide science education opportunities for high school students and educators by organizing workshops and distribution of demonstration toolkits; (ii) provide opportunities for members of underrepresented groups and women in the PI research laboratories and increase diversity in the workplace; (iii) involve researchers at academic levels from undergraduate to postdoc and mentor these coworkers to sharpen their research and scientific communication skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this collaborative research project, the  teams of Manashi Nath and Xinhua Liang from Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology will together studying the surface chemistry of transition metal chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts. Although transition metal chalcogenides have shown tremendous promise for catalytic water oxidation owing to their unprecedented high efficiency, there remains a lack of proper understanding of the active surface composition for these catalysts under operational conditions. In this project, the PIs will focus on bridging this knowledge gap by trying to understand the cause of high catalytic activity of transition metal selenide and telluride based electrocatalysts by following speciation and evolution of the active electrochemical interface through detailed in situ and ex situ characterizations of experimentally created surface model analogues, along with density functional theory (DFT) studies. The PIs hypothesize that the catalytic chalcogenide surface in alkaline medium can potentially be described by two different structural models: one resulting from complete chemical conversion of chalcogenide to oxide surface leading to oxide-coated chalcogenide surface, and the other comprising partially hydroxylated mixed anionic (hydroxy)chalcogenide surface which retains compositional integrity of the chalcogenide. The PIs further propose the mixed anionic (hydroxyl)chalcogenide model to be more accurate description of the active surface. These hypotheses will be evaluated by synthesizing catalyst surfaces analogous to the oxide-coated chalcogenide and (hydroxy)chalcogenide models through electrodeposition and atomic layer deposition and collecting experimental evidence from a combination of extensive bulk and surface characterization techniques. Simulation studies will be performed to decipher local coordination environment around the catalytically active site under reactive conditions.

Noncommutativity played a fundamental role in the foundation of quantum mechanics, leading to the development of the branch of mathematics known as functional analysis. From its origins in physics, functional analysis has gained a life of its own and has found exciting applications in areas such as quantum information theory and quantum computing as well as control and systems theory. More recently, questions (about semi-definite programming and linear matrix inequalities) arising in the engineering literature have led to the development of a new subfield of functional analysis known as noncommutative function theory. This exciting new subfield sits at the intersection of noncommutative algebra, functional analysis, and operator theory, and it enjoys a wide variety of applications. Rather than deal with completely abstract mathematical objects, noncommutative function theory employs the use of concrete structures known as matrices, which are one of the fundamental noncommutative objects used in science, engineering and industry. This project aims to deepen the understanding of noncommutative function theory and consequently augment its connections to related mathematical fields. It will assist in the professional development of early researches and provide an up-to-date list of both solved and unsolved problems in the field of noncommutative function theory.&lt;br/&gt;             &lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of this project is to increase the interplay between noncommutative function theory, noncommutative algebra, and operator theory. Recently, theorems and advances have been made in noncommutative algebra through techniques in noncommutative function theory, complex analysis, and operator theory. Objects of interest will be noncommutative rational functions and how their evaluations on matrices and operators reveals algebraic information about the functions and the skew field they generate; there is a strong connection between the injectivity domains of noncommutative rational mappings, the invertibility sets of their Jacobian matrices, and whether the noncommutative rational mapping induces an automorphism of the free skew field. On the other hand, results from noncommutative algebra (such as the realization of a noncommutative rational function) will be used to deepen the understanding of topics in mathematical analysis. Employment of novel ideas from noncommutative algebra and noncommutative function theory will provide new insights into the study of optimal polynomial approximants and related areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",08/02/2022,08/02/2022,,Grant,47.049,1,4900,4900,2155033,Meric,Augat,L,,Meric L Augat,maugat@wustl.edu,000838246,08/02/2022,,Principal Investigator,Song,Fang,,,Song Fang,songf@ou.edu,000800154,08/20/2022,,Principal Investigator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Washington University,SAINT LOUIS,631304862,3147474134,ONE BROOKINGS DR,,United States,Missouri,MO,01,MO01,L6NFUM28LQM5,"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, THE",L6NFUM28LQM5,Washington University,,MO,631304899,,US,United States,Missouri,1,01,MO01,1281,ANALYSIS PROGRAM,025Z,SaTC: Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace,,,,01002223DB,NSF RESEARCH & RELATED ACTIVIT,040100,2022~110448,7923,SMALL PROJECT,8060,Secure &Trustworthy Cyberspace,,9150,EXP PROG TO STIM COMP RES,,,,,SaTC: CORE: Small: Exploiting Stimulus-response Correlation for Wireless Hidden Device Localization,NSF,10/01/2022,09/30/2025,500000.00,500000,Standard Grant,05050000,CSE,Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr,CNS,Division Of Computer and Network Systems,James Joshi,jjoshi@nsf.gov,7032928950,"Smart Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, such as wireless cameras and voice-controlled devices, commonly employ motion or voice activity detection for increased security and convenience, so that upon detecting physical stimuli (e.g., motion or sound), they start to work and upload the sensing data to the cloud. The ubiquity of such devices also brings privacy concerns associated with unauthorized monitoring, as they can be kept hidden easily in various locations like hotel rooms. Traditional ways to detect a wireless hidden device mainly include Radio Frequency (RF) scanning, lens detection, and physical search. The latter two methods are cumbersome as they require inspecting every corner of the target area. RF scanning may work when the device is actively transmitting, but existing work can only detect a sensor's existence, not its exact location. However, detection is often insufficient, as the device owner may claim it is somewhere outside of the room or installed by others. By finding the physical device, a victim whose privacy is violated can obtain direct and solid evidence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on investigating causality between stimuli to hidden wireless devices and resultant patterns in observable wireless traffic.

A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law that governs the way points move over time. Such abstract dynamical systems form the basis for models of a wide range of important phenomena in science and engineering. It turns out that many questions in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation. This research project aims to advance the framework of algebraic dynamical systems in approximation theory, develop new methods, and obtain far-reaching generalizations of results in the field. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and introduced to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamics. These students will also supervise research projects within the framework of the PRIMES program, an after-school research program for high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During recent years there have been important developments concerning connections between Diophantine approximation and dynamical systems.

The mean field equation and the Allen-Cahn equation are two important types of nonlinear PDE that have arisen in the study of physical phenomena such as electroweak interaction and Chern-Simons-Higgs quantum field theories, statistical mechanics of two-dimensional turbulence, phase separation, and phase transitions. The mean field equation is also related to the study of general relativity as well as to cosmology. An important aspect of the Allen-Cahn equation is the formation of interfaces separating different physical regions of interest, which often have area minimizing properties, seen in minimal surfaces such as soap bubbles. This research project aims to advance understanding of these important equations through use of a mathematical tool recently developed by the investigator and collaborators. The project involves students at both undergraduate and graduate levels in interdisciplinary research. Postdoctoral fellows and junior researchers will also participate in and be trained as part of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator plans to investigate the newly discovered sphere covering inequality (SCI) in high dimensions and various other generalizations. Applications to the mean field equation and its high-dimensional counterpart will be explored. The SCI connects geometry to analysis and has become a powerful tool in the study of two-dimensional nonlinear PDE. High-dimensional SCIs have potential for study of conformal geometry, such as improved Beckner's inequalities and uniqueness of solutions to higher order equations involving Paneitz operators. For the Allen-Cahn equation, the PI will focus on the level set structure of solutions of finite Morse index, such as, for example, the relation between the level sets of solutions and minimal surfaces. In particular, a classification of stable solutions in three dimensions will be pursued. The PI intends to use various identities and energy estimates as well as Morse index information to develop a new approach for these non-monotone, non-minimizing solutions.

Central to this research is a recent discovery made by the Majireck research group that reactive compounds known as N-quaternized ketene N,O-acetals, typically too delicate to be handled, can be prepared in a manner that stabilizes them. This important finding opens the door for such materials to be employed for the first time in the synthesis of a broad range of valuable compounds. For example, a goal of the funded project is to use the newly available class of N,O-acetals for the preparation of biologically active nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds commonly found as components in active pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the research team will investigate a variety of processes involving the new reagents to uncover efficient methods for chemical manufacture that are straightforward and devoid of expensive additives, such as precious metal catalysts. The broader impacts of the project will extend to supporting research-based academic courses and summer research experiences for undergraduate students in synthetic organic chemistry at Hamilton College, with an emphasis on recruiting, training, and retaining students from underrepresented groups for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;N-Quaternized ketene N,O-acetals have been overlooked as reagents in organic synthesis due to their typical instability and/or specialized means of generation in situ. However, it was recently discovered that certain compounds within this class, and particularly pyridinium ketene N,O-acetals, have long-term bench-stability that allows for their preparation and purification in a straightforward manner. This opens up the possibility of leveraging N-quaternized ketene N,O-acetals as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. For example, such compounds can act as a source of thermally-generated O-alkyl ketenium ions, which can be used in acid catalyst-free Friedel-Crafts acylations, or in various cycloaddition reactions. Beyond the continued explorations of these kinds of processes, Dr. Majireck and his team of undergraduate students will also study the use of 2-halo-N-(1-alkoxyvinyl)pyridinium salts as electrophiles for the production of 2-aminopyridine derivatives via mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions.
